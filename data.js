Not having to go to every class was pretty nice specifically today. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do any homework today, but at least I showered, right? Ok that isn't really a valid excuse but still. Today was a good day, but it wasn't productive, so let's hope I'll do more tomorrow."],

This is because this is the week that high school begins for me.\nOther than that, I finished up my annoying Math summer homework (finally), and am aiming to complete the LA stuff tomorrow. Overall, a pretty good day; I don't know whether to put this in 6/10 or 7/10 but I'm leaning towards 6/10 due to today being pretty uneventful (of course, it was still good, though)."],

Other than that, today's 6/10 productivity is cancelled by the 4/10 rest of the day, with me doing nothing, as well as taking a 4 hour nap in the middle. Tomorrow is the final day before high school begins, so let's hope it's a good one! (actually it will probably just be another 5/10)"],

Also, I guess I was right about today being a 5/10 yesterday. Anyway, I fnished up the remaining portion of the LA homework just in time, and the rest of the day was basically nothing, so yeah. High school will make things more interesting, though..."],

I won't go into too much detail here, but it being the first day doesn't give it any bonus points. However, high school could go into any direction from here, and that thought was stuck in my head for the whole day. The reason I went to bed so early was because I was just genuinely tired, not to catch up on sleep."],

The reason this is 4/10 is because of an awkward moment that happened in Spanish class.

Would be 2/10 if things didn't get better at home, and also it's Friday, so it's time for the first weekend of high school! But anyway, the reason the school day was bad today was mainly because of 2 things: the work is getting obscenely difficult for just the 3rd day of school, and I sometimes just lose my ability to talk when I'm asked questions. I was also really tired, which could've contributed. But yeah, that's it, hopefully tomorrow is better."],

Definitely a good day, but nothing much else happened, so it's just going to be a 6/10. Still much better than yesterday for sure."],
