Find when x^3-4x^2+6 is negative, they said... also I wanted the exact answers, so no just plugging it in to Desmos (which is probably what they wanted me to do). Yeah, that didn't exactly go well considering it was casus irreducibilis, and if you don't know what that means, good."],

Not having to go to every class was pretty nice specifically today. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to do any homework today, but at least I showered, right?

This is because this is the week that high school begins for me.\nOther than that, I finished up my annoying Math summer homework (finally), and am aiming to complete the LA stuff tomorrow. Overall, a pretty good day; I don't know whether to put this in 6/10 or 7/10 but I'm leaning towards 6/10 due to today being pretty uneventful (of course, it was still good, though)."],

Other than that, today's 6/10 productivity is cancelled by the 4/10 rest of the day, with me doing nothing, as well as taking a 4 hour nap in the middle.

I won't go into too much detail here, but it being the first day doesn't give it any bonus points. However, high school could go into any direction from here, and that thought was stuck in my head for the whole day.

Would be 2/10 if things didn't get better at home, and also it's Friday, so it's time for the first weekend of high school! But anyway, the reason the school day was bad today was mainly because of 2 things: the work is getting obscenely difficult for just the 3rd day of school, and I sometimes just lose my ability to talk when I'm asked questions. I was also really tired, which could've contributed. But yeah, that's it, hopefully tomorrow is better."],

Definitely a good day, but nothing much else happened, so it's just going to be a 6/10. Still much better than yesterday for sure."],
