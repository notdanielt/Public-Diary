This is because this is the week that high school begins for me.\nOther than that, I finished up my annoying Math summer homework (finally), and am aiming to complete the LA stuff tomorrow. Overall, a pretty good day; I don't know whether to put this in 6/10 or 7/10 but I'm leaning towards 6/10 due to today being pretty uneventful (of course, it was still good, though)."],
